# CEP Extension Installer

CEP Extension Installer, is a redistributable installer for CEP extensions, it's meant to be used by extension developers as an efficent and professional way to package their extensions for installation outside of the Adobe Add-ons service.

# How it works

Extension Installer is built on top of the source code found in the well known and popular, [ZXPInstaller](https://github.com/CreativeDo/ZXPInstaller) by CreativeDo, this installer simply removes the drag and drop features, replacing the extension path with a harddcoded one, as well as replacing the design by one inspired by Adobe's latest installer design.

# Setup (OS X and Windows)

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

1. Install the dependencies and start the app.

  ```
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

# Editing the installer for your extension

You will need the following things:
* An extension packaged in AdobeÂ´s ZXP format, with proper timestamping.
* An icon for your extension (If you don't have one, use the generic zxp icon that comes with the repository.)

1. Head into the index.html file located within the `assets` folder and modify the following HTML fields:
* `productName` - Replace it with the name of your extension.
* `productVersion` - Replace it with the version number of the extension you are installing.

2. Replace the `prodIcon.png` file located in the images folder with an icon for your extension, if you don't have one, feel free to keep the default one.

3. Head into the `bin` directory and add your extension in `.zxp` format there, unless you want to edit the code, i also recommend renaming your extensions to `extension.zxp`.

4. If you want to change the icons for the windows `.exe` or mac `.app` files, replace the `.ico` file(Windows) and the `.icns` file(Mac) in the assets folder with your own icons.

### Extra Steps

Since a Mac app is just a folder, it can easily be packaged, published and be "self-contained", in the case of windows, this is not the case and the installer requires several files and folders to function on Windows, making packaging of your extension difficult, at present there is no way to package an electron application to be "self-contained" on Windows. You can however use Enigma Virtual Box, to "self-contain" the installer: [http://enigmaprotector.com/en/aboutvb.html](http://enigmaprotector.com/en/aboutvb.html).

# Compiling (OS X)

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

1. Install `wine` and `makensis` for `electron-builder` (needed to build the Windows executable).

  ```
  brew install wine makensis
  ```

1. Run the build script

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

1. You will find the compiled binaries in the `release` directory.

# Compiling (Windows)

You can only compile the windows executable on Windows, you will need a Mac to compile the Mac version, the only way around this is to use a online build server, like AppVeyor which is free for open source projects: [https://www.appveyor.com/](https://www.appveyor.com/).

1. Run the build script for Windows
  ```
  npm run build:win
  ```
2. You will find the compiled Windows binary in the `win` folder within the `releases` folder.
